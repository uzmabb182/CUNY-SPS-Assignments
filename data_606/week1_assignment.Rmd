## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(openintro)
```
# Assignment 1:
## Data for present day birth records in the United States
```{r}
data('present', package='openintro')
```

```{r}
present
```

```{r}
glimpse(present)
```
# Some Exploration:
## To access the data in a single column
```{r}
present$boys
```
#Exercise 1: to extract just the counts of girls birth record in US
```{r}
count(present, "girls")
```
## Below is the vector prsentation of count
```{r}
present$girls
```
# Data Visualization:
## simple scatter plot of the number of girls birth record per year using ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(data = present, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + 
  geom_point()
```
## simple line plot of the number of girls birth record per year in US using ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(data = present, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + 
  geom_line()
```
## Exercise 2: From 1940 to 1960 there is increase in the number of girls born per year. 
## Then from 1980 to 2000 there is a increase in the number of girls born per year.
```{r}
present$boys + present$girls
```
## Adding a new variable to the dataframe
```{r}
present <- present %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)
present
```
## Exercise 3: To generate a plot of the proportion of boys born over time

```{r}
present <- present %>%
  mutate(boy_ratio = boys/total)
present
```
## Analysis: You can see below that there is a consistant fall pattern of boys birth ratio per year
```{r}
ggplot(data = present, aes(x = year, y = boy_ratio)) + 
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = present, aes(x = year, y = boy_ratio)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm) # add linear trend line
  
```

```{r}
# boys birth ratio per year is a downward slope from 1940 to 2000
```

```{r}
present <- present %>%
  mutate(boy_to_girl_ratio = boys / girls)
present
```
## To see the boolean output if the boys are more than girls
```{r}
present <- present %>%
  mutate(more_boys = boys > girls)
present
```

```{r}
present %>%
  summarize(min = min(boys), max = max(boys))
```
# Exercise 4:
## What years are included in this data set? 
```{r}
present$year
```
# Exercise 4:
## How to get dimensions of a dataframe
```{r}
glimpse(present)
```

```{r}
dim(present)
```
# Exercise 4:
## What are the variable (column) names?
```{r}
colnames(present)
```
# Exercise 5:
## How do these counts compare to Arbuthnot’s? Are they of a similar magnitude?
## As you can see there is amajor difference in the magnitude of means
```{r}
# arbuthnot data mean is:
mean(arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls)
```

```{r}
# present data mean is:
mean(present$boys + present$girls)
```
# Exercise 6
# Make a plot that displays the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see? 
# Does Arbuthnot’s observation about boys being born in greater proportion 
# than girls hold up in the U.S.? 
# Include the plot in your response
```{r}
present <- present %>%
  mutate(girl_ratio = girls/total)
present
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = present, aes(x = year, y = girl_ratio)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm) # add linear trend line
```

```{r}
# Analysis: you can see that the girls birth ratio increases from 1940 to 2000
# Whereas the boys birth ratio is decreasing from 1940 to 2000
```
# Exercise 7:
## In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.? 
## Hint: First calculate the totals and save it as a new variable. 
```{r}
present <- present %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)
present
```

```{r}
total_desc <- present %>%
  arrange(desc(total))
total_desc
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = present, aes(x = year, y = total)) + 
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
# 1960 is the year where you can see the most total number of births in the U.S.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
