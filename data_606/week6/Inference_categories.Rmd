## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(ggplot2)
library(infer)
```

# The Data
```{r}
yrbss
```
```{r}
count_yrbss <- count(yrbss)
count_yrbss
```


# Exercise 1:
# What are the counts within each category for the amount of days these students have texted while driving 
# within the past 30 days?
```{r}
female_df <- yrbss %>% filter(gender == "female")
female_df
```

```{r}
female_count <-  count(female_df)
female_count
```

```{r}
male_df <- yrbss %>% filter(gender == "male")
male_df
```

```{r}
male_count <-  count(male_df)
male_count
```
# Exercise 2:
# What is the proportion of people who have texted while driving every day in the past 30 days and never wear helmets?
```{r}
helmet_never_df <-  yrbss %>% filter(helmet_12m == "never") %>% filter(!text_while_driving_30d %in% c("did not drive","NA","0")) 
helmet_never_df
```
```{r}

```


```{r}
count_helmet_never <- count(helmet_never_df)
count_helmet_never
```

```{r}
prop_texted <- (count_helmet_never/count_yrbss)*100
prop_texted
```
# Inference on proportions:

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
