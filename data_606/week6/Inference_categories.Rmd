## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(ggplot2)
library(infer)
```

# The Data
```{r}
yrbss
```

```{r}
count_yrbss <- count(yrbss)
count_yrbss
```

# Exercise 1:
# What are the counts within each category for the amount of days these students have texted while driving 
# within the past 30 days?

```{r}
count_each <-yrbss%>%
  count(text_while_driving_30d)
count_each
```

# Exercise 2:
# What is the proportion of people who have texted while driving every day in the past 30 days and never wear helmets?

```{r}
no_helmet <- yrbss %>%
  filter(helmet_12m == "never")
no_helmet <- no_helmet %>%
  mutate(text_ind = ifelse(text_while_driving_30d == "30", "yes", "no"))

no_helmet%>%
  count(text_ind)
```
# Inference on proportions:

```{r}
no_helmet %>%
  specify(response = text_ind, success = "yes") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)
```
# Exercise 3

# What is the margin of error for the estimate of the proportion of non-helmet wearers that have texted while 
# driving each day for the past 30 days based on this survey?

```{r}
n = 6977
z = 1.96
p <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01)
me <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p)/n)
me = 0.004
```

# Exercise 4:
#calculate confidence intervals for two other categorical variables

```{r}
good_sleep <- yrbss%>%
  mutate(slept_well = ifelse(school_night_hours_sleep > 5, "yes", "no"))

good_sleep%>%
    specify(response = slept_well, success = "yes") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)
```


```{r}
no_tv <- yrbss %>%
  mutate(did_not_watch_tv = ifelse(hours_tv_per_school_day == "do not watch", "yes", "no") )

no_tv %>%
  specify(response = did_not_watch_tv, success = "yes") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)

```
# How does the proportion affect the margin of error?

```{r}
n <- 1000
p <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01)
me <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p)/n)
dd <- data.frame(p = p, me = me)
ggplot(data = dd, aes(x = p, y = me)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Population Proportion", y = "Margin of Error")

```
# Exercise 5:

Describe the relationship between p and me. Include the margin of error vs. population proportion plot you constructed in your answer. 
For a given sample size, for which value of p is margin of error maximized?
```{r}
# The margin of error increases as the population proportion increases. And after 50% it begins to decrease.
```
# Exercise 6:
# Describe the sampling distribution of sample proportions at n=300 and p=0.1. Be sure to note the center, spread, and shape.

```{r}
# The distribution is normal. The center is at 0.1 and the spread is between 0.04 and 0.17

p <- 0.1
n <- 300

n*p

n*(1-p)


```
# Exercise 7:
#Keep n constant and change p. How does the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution vary as p changes. 
#You might want to adjust min and max for the x-axis for a better view of the distribution.

```{r}
# The distribution seems to be normal. The center is at 0.1 and the spread is between 0.05 and 0.16

p <- 0.5
n <- 300

n*p

n*(1-p)
```
# Exercsie 8:
#Now also change n. How does n appear to affect the distribution of p^?

```{r}
# When n decrease the spread increase 

p <- 0.5
n <- 200

n*p

n*(1-p)
p <- 0.5
n <- 200

n*p

n*(1-p)
```
# Exercise 9:

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in strength training between students that sleep more than 10+ hours and those who don’t.

Alternative: There is a difference in strength training between students that sleep more than 10+ hours and those who don’t.

There is a 95% confident that the student proportion of those students that sleep more than 10+ hours are between 0.221 and 0.321.

```{r}
good_sleep <- yrbss  %>%
  filter(school_night_hours_sleep == "10+")
good_sleep <- good_sleep %>%
  mutate(strength = ifelse(strength_training_7d == "7", "yes", "no"))
good_sleep %>%
  specify(response = strength, success = "yes") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)
```

# Exercise 10:

```{r}
# There would be a 5% chance of detecting a change. A type 1 error is a false positive
```

# Exercise 11:

```{r}
# ME = 1.96 * SE=1.96 * sqrtp(1−p)/n

# n = (0.3)2/(0.01/1.96)2

# n= 3457
```


```{r}

```
