# Load Packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
library(ggplot2)
```

# The Data:
# Load the yrbss data set
```{r}
data('yrbss', package='openintro')

```

# Exercise 1:
# What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there in our sample?
```{r}
glimpse(yrbss)
```
# Exploratory data analysis:

```{r}
summary(yrbss$weight)
```
# Exercise 2:
# How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r}
colSums(is.na(yrbss))
```
# Extract Rows with NA in Specific Column

```{r}
na_weight <- yrbss[is.na(yrbss$weight), ]  
nrow(na_weight)
```

# create a new variable physical_3plus, which will be coded as either “yes” if they are 
# physically active for at least 3 days a week, and “no” if not.

```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(yrbss$physically_active_7d > 2, "yes", "no"))

yrbss
```
# Relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity
```{r}
ggplot(data=yrbss, mapping = aes(x = physically_active_7d, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = weight)) +
  theme_bw()
```

# Exercise 3:
# Make a side-by-side boxplot of physical_3plus and weight. 
# Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r}
# Median looks similar as well as IQR
yrbss$physical_3plus<-as.factor(yrbss$physical_3plus)
yrb_plot<-yrbss%>%
  filter(!is.na(weight),!is.na(physical_3plus))
p<-ggplot(yrb_plot, aes(x=physical_3plus,y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()
p
```

# Comparing the mean of two groups of physical exercise 
```{r}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```
# Inference:

#Exercise 4:
# Are all conditions necessary for inference satisfied? 
# Comment on each. You can compute the group sizes with the 
# summarize command above by defining a new variable with the definition n().
```{r}
# the two gropus are independent and groups are less than 10% of population
```

```{r}
#create new variable n

yrbss<- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(n = ifelse(yrbss$physically_active_7d > 2, "yes", "no"))

yrbss$n<-as.factor(yrbss$n)

view(yrbss)
yrbss%>%
 count(n)

# Exercise 5:

# Hypothesis test:

# H_0: the difference in the means between physical 3 plus and less than 3 are equal (mean1-mean2)=0 
# H_A: the weights are diffferent !=0

  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}

# How many of these null permutations have a difference of at least obs_stat?
