## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# Load Packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
```

# The Data:
# Load the yrbss data set
```{r}
data('yrbss', package='openintro')

```

# Exercise 1:
# What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there in our sample?
```{r}
glimpse(yrbss)
```
# Exploratory data analysis:

```{r}
summary(yrbss$weight)
```
# Exercise 2:
# How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r}
colSums(is.na(yrbss))
```
# Extract Rows with NA in Specific Column

```{r}
na_weight <- yrbss[is.na(yrbss$weight), ]  
nrow(na_weight)
```

```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(yrbss$physically_active_7d > 2, "yes", "no"))

yrbss
```
