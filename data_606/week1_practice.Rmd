## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(openintro)
```

```{r}
data('arbuthnot', package='openintro')
```

```{r}
arbuthnot
```

```{r}
glimpse(arbuthnot)
```
# Some Exploration:
## To access the data in a single column
```{r}
arbuthnot$boys
```
#Exercise 1: to extract just the counts of girls baptized? 
```{r}
count(arbuthnot, "girls")
```
## Below is the vector prsentation of count
```{r}
arbuthnot$girls
```
# Data Visualization:
## simple scatter plot of the number of girls baptized per year using ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + 
  geom_point()
```
## simple line plot of the number of girls baptized per year using ggplot
```{r}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + 
  geom_line()
```
## Exercise 2: From 1640 to 1660 there is drop in the number of girls baptized per year. 
## From 1660 to 1700 there is a prominant increase in the number of girls baptized per year.
```{r}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```
## Adding a new variable to the dataframe
```{r}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)
arbuthnot
```
## Exercise 3: To generate a plot of the proportion of boys born over time

```{r}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(boy_ratio = boys/total)
arbuthnot
```
## Analysis: You can see that there is a consistant balance in the rise and fall pattern of boys ratio per year
```{r}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = boy_ratio)) + 
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(boy_to_girl_ratio = boys / girls)
arbuthnot
```
## To see the boolean output if the boys are more than girls
```{r}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(more_boys = boys > girls)
arbuthnot
```

```{r}
arbuthnot %>%
  summarize(min = min(boys), max = max(boys))
```
# Assignment 2:
## For present day birth records in the United States
```{r}
data('present', package='openintro')
present
```

```{r}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
