# Analysis:
## Departure Delays:
```{r}
# the distribution of departure delays of all flights with a histogram.
ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
#  define the binwidth
ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15)
```
# Exercise 1:
## Look carefully at these three histograms. How do they compare? 
## Are features revealed in one that are obscured in another?
```{r}
# Increasing the binwidth, presents more detail of data but unnecessary larger bandwidth 
# hides the changes in data. First histogram is the most balanced presenration
ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 150)
```

```{r}
#  to visualize only on delays of flights headed to Los Angeles
LAX_flights <- nycflights %>% filter(dest == "LAX")

ggplot(data = LAX_flights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# obtain numerical summaries for LA flights

LAX_flights %>%
  summarize(mean_LAX   = mean(dep_delay), 
            median_LAX  = median(dep_delay), 
            count       = n(),
            stdev       = sd(dep_delay),
            Inter_quart_range = IQR(dep_delay),
            min_valve = min(dep_delay),
            max_value = max(dep_delay))

```
# Exercise 2:
## Create a new data frame that includes flights headed to SFO in February, 
## and save this data frame as sfo_feb_flights. How many flights meet these criteria?
```{r}
# Selecting data for JFK airport
SFO_airport <- nycflights %>%
 filter(dest =="SFO", month == 2) 
SFO_airport
```

```{r}
# The count of flights that meet the criteria
nrow(SFO_airport)
```
# Exercise 3:
## Describe the distribution of the arrival delays of these flights using a histogram 
## and appropriate summary statistics

```{r}
ggplot(data = SFO_airport, aes(x = arr_delay)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# obtain numerical summaries for SFO flights

SFO_airport %>%
  summarise(mean_SFO   = mean(arr_delay), 
            median_SFO  = median(arr_delay), 
            count       = n(),
            stdev       = sd(arr_delay),
            Inter_quart_range = IQR(arr_delay),
            min_valve = min(arr_delay),
            max_value = max(arr_delay))

```
# Exercise 4:
## Calculate the median and interquartile range for arr_delays 
## of flights in the sfo_airport data frame, grouped by carrier. 
## Which carrier has the most variable arrival delays?
```{r}
# The UA and DL carriers has the most variable arrival delays because the IQR is the widest spread range
SFO_airport %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(median_sfo = median(arr_delay),
            Inter_quart_range = IQR(arr_delay),
            count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
# Departure Delays by Month:
## Which month would you expect to have the highest average delay departing from an NYC airport?

```{r}
# The flights group by month shows that July is the highest average delay departing from an NYC airport

nycflights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(mean_nyc = mean(dep_delay),
            median_nyc = median(dep_delay)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_nyc))
  
```
# Exercise 5:
## Suppose you really dislike departure delays and you want to schedule your travel in a month that minimizes your ## potential departure delay leaving NYC. One option is to choose the month with the lowest mean departure delay. ## Another option is to choose the month with the lowest median departure delay. 
## What are the pros and cons of  these two choices?

```{r}
# pros and cons: Mean values sometimes get effected by the outliers and resulted in a wrong judgement
# So its better to consider median value
```
# On Time Departure rate for NYC Airports:
## flying out of NYC and want to know which of the three major NYC airports has the best on time 
## departure rate of departing flights
```{r}
# classifying each flight as “on time” or “delayed” by creating a new variable with the mutate function.
nycflights <- nycflights %>%
  mutate(dep_type = ifelse(dep_delay < 5, "on time", "delayed"))

nycflights
```

```{r}
# We can now find best on time rate NYC airport  

nycflights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(dep_rate = sum(dep_type == "on time") / n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_rate))
```
# Exercise 6:
## If you were selecting an airport simply based on on time departure percentage, 
## which NYC airport would you choose to fly out of?

```{r}
# We can now visualize the results above and conclude that LGA has the best departure percentage

ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = origin, fill = dep_type)) +
  geom_bar()
```
# More Practice:
# Exercise 7:
## Mutate the data frame so that it includes a new variable that contains the average speed, 
## avg_speed traveled by the plane for each flight (in mph)
```{r}
nycflights <- nycflights %>%
  mutate(avg_speed = distance / (air_time / 60))

nycflights
```
# Exercise 8:
# Make a scatterplot of avg_speed vs. distance. Describe the relationship between average speed and distance. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = distance, y = avg_speed, color= carrier)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm) # add linear trend line
```
# Exercise 9:
## Replicate the following plot
```{r}
filtered_carrier <- nycflights %>%
  filter(carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL" | carrier == "UA")
# Now draw the plot
ggplot(data = filtered_carrier, aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay, color= carrier)) + geom_point()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
