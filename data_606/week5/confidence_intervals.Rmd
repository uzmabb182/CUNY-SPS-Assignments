# we will assume a total population size of 100,000 (even though that’s smaller than the population size of all US adults).
# In this lab, you will assume this 62% is a true population proportion and learn about how sample proportions can vary from 
# of 100,000. This means 62,000 (62%) of the adult population think climate change impacts their community, 
# and the remaining 38,000 does not think so.

```{r}
us_adults <- tibble(
  climate_change_affects = c(rep("Yes", 62000), rep("No", 38000))
)

us_adults
```
# We can quickly visualize the distribution of these responses using a bar plot.

```{r}
ggplot(us_adults, aes(x = climate_change_affects)) +
  geom_bar(fill = 'blue') +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you think climate change is affecting your local community?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

# We can also obtain summary statistics to confirm we constructed the data frame correctly.

```{r}
us_adults %>%
  count(climate_change_affects) %>%
  mutate(p = n /sum(n))
```

# a simple random sample of size 60 from the population.

```{r}
n <- 60
samp <- us_adults %>%
  sample_n(size = n)

samp
```
# Exercise 1:

# What percent of the adults in your sample think climate change affects their local community?

```{r}
# 62% of the adults in the sample think that the climate change affects their local community
```

# Exercise 2:

# Would you expect another student’s sample proportion to be identical to yours? Would you expect it to be similar? 
Why or why not?

```{r}
# No we would not expect the samples proportion to be identical but they can be similar.
```

```{r}
# With just one sample, the best estimate of the proportion of US adults who think climate change affects their 
# local community would be the sample proportion, usually denoted as p^ (here we are calling it p_hat). 
# That serves as a good point estimate, but it would be useful to also communicate how uncertain you are of 
# that estimate. This uncertainty can be quantified using a confidence interval.

# One way of calculating a confidence interval for a population proportion is based on the Central Limit Theorem
# Another way is using simulation, or to be more specific, using bootstrapping
```

# Exercise 3:

# In the interpretation above, we used the phrase “95% confident”. What does “95% confidence” mean?
# This code will find the 95 percent confidence interval for proportion of US adults who think 
# climate change affects their local community.

```{r}
samp %>%
  specify(response = climate_change_affects, success = "Yes") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  get_ci(level = 0.95)
```
# Even though we don’t know what the full population looks like, we’re 95% confident that the 
# true proportion of US adults who think climate change affects their local community is between 
# the two bounds reported as result of this pipeline.


# Confidence levels:

# Exercise 4:

# Does your confidence interval capture the true population proportion of US adults who think 
# climate change affects their local community? If you are working on this lab in a classroom, 
# does your neighbor’s interval capture this value?

```{r}
# Will 62% of the adults in the sample represent the actual thinking of the total population that the climate change affects their local community? This is where the confidence interval come into play. 

# If we repeatedly take the sampling then there is 95% confidence interval that the 62% of the adults in the sample represent the actual thinking of the total population lies between the lower limit of 0.333 and upper limit of 0.583 confidence interval. 

# The interval that is shown 33.3% through 58.3% has 45.8% in the exact center. Adding 12.5% to 45.8% gives us the upper limit of the interval, which is 58.3%. and subtracting 12.5% to 45.8% gives the lower limit of the interval.

# This +/-12.5% difference for achieving the upper and lower limit for 95% confidence of interval is called 'margin of error'.
```

# Exercise 5:
# Each student should have gotten a slightly different confidence interval. What proportion of those 
# intervals would you expect to capture the true population mean? Why?
```{r}
# The +/-Margin of Error to the mean gives the upper and lower limit for the confidence of interval. And there is 95% probability that the actual population proportion falls in the upper and lower limit of the confidence interval.
```

# Exercise 6:
#Given a sample size of 60, 1000 bootstrap samples for each interval, and 50 confidence intervals constructed 
# (the default values for the above app), what proportion of your confidence intervals include the 
# true population proportion? Is this proportion exactly equal to the confidence level? 
# If not, explain why. Make sure to include your plot in your answer.

```{r}
