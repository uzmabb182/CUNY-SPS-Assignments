# Load Packages:
```{r}

library(infer)
```

# we will assume a total population size of 100,000 (even though that’s smaller than the population size of all US adults).
# In this lab, you will assume this 62% is a true population proportion and learn about how sample proportions can vary from 
# of 100,000. This means 62,000 (62%) of the adult population think climate change impacts their community, 
# and the remaining 38,000 does not think so.

```{r}
us_adults <- tibble(
  climate_change_affects = c(rep("Yes", 62000), rep("No", 38000))
)

us_adults
```
# We can quickly visualize the distribution of these responses using a bar plot.

```{r}
ggplot(us_adults, aes(x = climate_change_affects)) +
  geom_bar(fill = 'blue') +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you think climate change is affecting your local community?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

# We can also obtain summary statistics to confirm we constructed the data frame correctly.

```{r}
us_adults %>%
  count(climate_change_affects) %>%
  mutate(p = n /sum(n))
```

# a simple random sample of size 60 from the population.

```{r}
n <- 60
samp <- us_adults %>%
  sample_n(size = n)

samp
```
# Exercise 1:

# What percent of the adults in your sample think climate change affects their local community?

```{r}
# 62% of the adults in the sample think that the climate change affects their local community
```

# Exercise 2:

# Would you expect another student’s sample proportion to be identical to yours? Would you expect it to be similar? 
Why or why not?

```{r}
# No we would not expect the samples proportion to be identical but they can be similar.
```

```{r}
# With just one sample, the best estimate of the proportion of US adults who think climate change affects their 
# local community would be the sample proportion, usually denoted as p^ (here we are calling it p_hat). 
# That serves as a good point estimate, but it would be useful to also communicate how uncertain you are of 
# that estimate. This uncertainty can be quantified using a confidence interval.

# One way of calculating a confidence interval for a population proportion is based on the Central Limit Theorem
# Another way is using simulation, or to be more specific, using bootstrapping
```

# Exercise 3:

# In the interpretation above, we used the phrase “95% confident”. What does “95% confidence” mean?
# This code will find the 95 percent confidence interval for proportion of US adults who think 
# climate change affects their local community.

```{r}
