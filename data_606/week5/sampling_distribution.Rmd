## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Load Packages:
```{r}
install.packages("infer")

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
```
# The Data:

# We will first create our population assuming a population size of 100,000. This means 20,000 (20%) of the 
# population think the work scientists do does not benefit them personally and the remaining 80,000
# think it does.
```{r}
global_monitor <- tibble(
  scientist_work = c(rep("Benefits", 80000), rep("Doesn't benefit", 20000))
)

global_monitor
```

# To visualize the distribution of these responses using a bar plot.
```{r}
ggplot(global_monitor, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

# Summary statistics to confirm we constructed the data frame correctly.
```{r}
global_monitor %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p = n /sum(n))
```
# The unknown sampling distribution:
# Use the sample_n command to survey the population.
```{r}
samp1 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(50)

samp1
```
# Exercise 1:
# Describe the distribution of responses in this sample. How does it compare to the distribution of 
# responses in the population.
# Estimating the proportion of all people who do not believe that the work scientists do benefits them
# by guessing the sample mean 

```{r}
samp1 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n))
```
# The distribution of the responses in this sample is slightly different with 86% benifits 
# and 14% doesn't benefit
```{r}
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

```{r}
