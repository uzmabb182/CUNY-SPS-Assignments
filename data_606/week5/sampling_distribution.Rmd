# Load Packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
```
# The Data:

# We will first create our population assuming a population size of 100,000. This means 20,000 (20%) of the 
# population think the work scientists do does not benefit them personally and the remaining 80,000
# think it does.
```{r}
global_monitor <- tibble(
  scientist_work = c(rep("Benefits", 80000), rep("Doesn't benefit", 20000))
)

global_monitor
```

# To visualize the distribution of these responses using a bar plot.
```{r}
ggplot(global_monitor, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

# Summary statistics to confirm we constructed the data frame correctly.
```{r}
global_monitor %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p = n /sum(n))
```
# The unknown sampling distribution:
# Use the sample_n command to survey the population.
```{r}
samp1 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(50)

samp1
```
# Exercise 1:
# Describe the distribution of responses in this sample. How does it compare to the distribution of 
# responses in the population.
# Estimating the proportion of all people who do not believe that the work scientists do benefits them
# by guessing the sample mean 

```{r}
samp1 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n))
```
# The distribution of the responses in this sample is slightly different with 86% benifits 
# and 14% doesn't benefit
```{r}
 ggplot(samp1, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```
Exercise 2:
# Would you expect the sample proportion to match the sample proportion of another student’s sample? 
# Why, or why not? If the answer is no, would you expect the proportions to be somewhat different 
# or very different?


```{r}
# I would expect the sample proportion to not match the the sample proportion of another student’s sample.
# Because each time we take random sample from the population which is a large pool of 100000. 
# This will bring a different sample data each time.
```

Exercise 3:
# Take a second sample, also of size 50, and call it samp2. How does the sample proportion of samp2 
# compare with that of samp1? Suppose we took two more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. 
# Which would you think would provide a more accurate estimate of the population proportion?

```{r}
samp2 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(50)
samp2 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n))
```
# To visualize the result
```{r}
 ggplot(samp2, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "purple") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

```{r}
# The data is a bit different in samp2, with more people in group ‘doesn’t benefit’. 
# Also, the sample size is so small it also has a large impact on the p_hat.
```

```{r}
# sample 100

samp3 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(100)

samp3 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p3 = n /sum(n))
```

```{r}
ggplot(samp3, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(), width = 0.5, fill = "blue" ) +
    coord_flip() + 
    ggtitle("Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit sample 0f 100?") +
    xlab("") + ylab("")
```

```{r}
# sample 1000

samp4 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(1000)

samp4 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p4 = n /sum(n))
```

```{r}
ggplot(samp4, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(), width = 0.5, fill = "green" ) +
    coord_flip() + 
    ggtitle("Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit sample 0f 10000?") +
    xlab("") + ylab("")
```

```{r}
# Everytime we take a different size sample, we get different proportion of results. The distribution of sample # proportions, called the sampling distribution (of the proportion), can help us understand this variability.

# In this lab, because you have access to the population, you can build up the sampling distribution for the 
# sample proportion by repeating the above steps many times. 
```

# Use R to take 15,000 different samples of size 50 from the population, calculate the proportion of 
# responses in each sample, filter for only the Doesn’t benefit responses, and store each result 
# in a vector called sample_props50.

```{r}
sample_props50 <- global_monitor %>%
                    rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 15000, replace = TRUE) %>%
                    count(scientist_work) %>%
                    mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n)) %>%
                    filter(scientist_work == "Doesn't benefit")

sample_props50
```
# Now visualize the distribution of these proportions with a histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(data = sample_props50, aes(x = p_hat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, fill = "blue") +
  labs(
    x = "p_hat (Doesn't benefit)",
    title = "Sampling distribution of p_hat",
    subtitle = "Sample size = 50, Number of samples = 15000"
  )
```

Exercise 4:
# How many elements are there in sample_props50? Describe the sampling distribution, 
# and be sure to specifically note its center. Make sure to include a plot 
# of the distribution in your answer.

```{r}
# There are 4 elements in sample_props50.
# 15000 samples were taken. This plot looks mostly normally distributed, with a slight skew to the right.
# The center seems to peak around .2 what looks consistent with the population distribution.
```

# Exercise 5:
# To make sure you understand how sampling distributions are built, and exactly what the rep_sample_n function 
# does, try modifying the code to create a sampling distribution of 25 sample proportions from samples 
# of size 10, and put them in a data frame named sample_props_small. Print the output. How many 
# observations are there in this object called sample_props_small? What does each observation represent?

```{r}
rep_sample_n <- global_monitor %>% rep_sample_n(size = 10, reps = 25, replace = TRUE) %>%
                    count(scientist_work) %>%
                    mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n)) %>%
                    filter(scientist_work == "Doesn't benefit")
rep_sample_n
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = rep_sample_n, aes(x = p_hat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, fill = "purple")
```
# Sample size and the sampling distribution:
# we used the rep_sample_n function: to compute a sampling distribution, specifically, 
# the sampling distribution of the proportions from samples of 50 people.


Exercise 6:
# Use the app below to create sampling distributions of proportions of Doesn’t benefit from samples of size 10, 
# 50, and 100. Use 5,000 simulations. What does each observation in the sampling distribution represent? 
# How does the mean, standard error, and shape of the sampling distribution change as the sample size increases? 
# How (if at all) do these values change if you increase the number of simulations? (You do not need to include 
# plots in your answer.)

```{r}
# Smaller  the sample size , the spread in the distribution response will get wider. The sampling distribution 
# shows what could be a right skewed distribution. As sample size increase, the spread in the distribution
