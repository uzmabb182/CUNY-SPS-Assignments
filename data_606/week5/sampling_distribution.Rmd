# Load Packages:
```{r}
install.packages("infer")

```{r}

library(infer)
```
# The Data:

# We will first create our population assuming a population size of 100,000. This means 20,000 (20%) of the 
# population think the work scientists do does not benefit them personally and the remaining 80,000
# think it does.
```{r}
global_monitor <- tibble(
  scientist_work = c(rep("Benefits", 80000), rep("Doesn't benefit", 20000))
)

global_monitor
```

# To visualize the distribution of these responses using a bar plot.
```{r}
ggplot(global_monitor, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

# Summary statistics to confirm we constructed the data frame correctly.
```{r}
global_monitor %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p = n /sum(n))
```
# The unknown sampling distribution:
# Use the sample_n command to survey the population.
```{r}
samp1 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(50)

samp1
```
# Exercise 1:
# Describe the distribution of responses in this sample. How does it compare to the distribution of 
# responses in the population.
# Estimating the proportion of all people who do not believe that the work scientists do benefits them
# by guessing the sample mean 

```{r}
samp1 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n))
```
# The distribution of the responses in this sample is slightly different with 86% benifits 
# and 14% doesn't benefit
```{r}
 ggplot(samp1, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```
Exercise 2:
# Would you expect the sample proportion to match the sample proportion of another student’s sample? 
# Why, or why not? If the answer is no, would you expect the proportions to be somewhat different 
# or very different?


```{r}
# I would expect the sample proportion to not match the the sample proportion of another student’s sample.
# Because each time we take random sample from the population which is a large pool of 100000. 
# This will bring a different sample data each time.
```

Exercise 3:
# Take a second sample, also of size 50, and call it samp2. How does the sample proportion of samp2 
# compare with that of samp1? Suppose we took two more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. 
# Which would you think would provide a more accurate estimate of the population proportion?

```{r}
samp2 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(50)
samp2 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p_hat = n /sum(n))
```
# To visualize the result
```{r}
 ggplot(samp2, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "purple") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "",
    title = "Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit people like you?"
  ) +
  coord_flip() 
```

```{r}
# The data is a bit different in samp2, with more people in group ‘doesn’t benefit’. 
# Also, the sample size is so small it also has a large impact on the p_hat.
```

```{r}
# sample 100

samp3 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(100)

samp3 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p3 = n /sum(n))
```

```{r}
ggplot(samp3, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(), width = 0.5, fill = "blue" ) +
    coord_flip() + 
    ggtitle("Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit sample 0f 100?") +
    xlab("") + ylab("")
```

```{r}
# sample 1000

samp4 <- global_monitor %>%
  sample_n(1000)

samp4 %>%
  count(scientist_work) %>%
  mutate(p4 = n /sum(n))
```

```{r}
ggplot(samp4, aes(x = scientist_work)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge(), width = 0.5, fill = "green" ) +
    coord_flip() + 
    ggtitle("Do you believe that the work scientists do benefit sample 0f 10000?") +
    xlab("") + ylab("")
```

```{r}
# Everytime we take a different size sample, we get different proportion of results. The distribution of sample proportions, called the sampling distribution (of the proportion), can help us understand this variability.
```

Exercise 4:
# How many elements are there in sample_props50? Describe the sampling distribution, 
# and be sure to specifically note its center. Make sure to include a plot 
# of the distribution in your answer.
