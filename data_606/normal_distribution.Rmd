## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


# load the packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

```


```{r}

data("fastfood", package='openintro')
head(fastfood)

```
# Filter the fastfood for values "Mcdonalds" and "Dairy Queen"
```{r}
mcdonalds <- fastfood %>%
  filter(restaurant == "Mcdonalds")

mcdonalds
```


```{r}
dairy_queen <- fastfood %>%
  filter(restaurant == "Dairy Queen")

dairy_queen
```

# Exercise 1: Make a plot (or plots) to visualize the distributions of the amount of calories from fat of the options 
# from these two restaurants. How do their centers, shapes, and spreads compare?

# Both the distributions are right skewed in the frequency histogram. There is a sudden drop in the distribution McDonalds fat calories data.
```{r}
mcdonalds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = cal_fat), bins = 5) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of McDonalds Fat Calories") +
  xlab("Calories from Fat") +
  ylab("Frequency")
```

```{r}
dairy_queen %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = cal_fat), bins = 5) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Dairy Queen Fat Calories") +
  xlab("Calories from Fat") +
  ylab("Frequency")
```
# Calculating the summary
```{r}
summary(mcdonalds$cal_fat)
hist(mcdonalds$cal_fat)
```

```{r}
summary(dairy_queen$cal_fat)
hist(dairy_queen$cal_fat)
```

# Calculating the mean and standard deviation
```{r}
dairy_queen_mean <- mean(dairy_queen$cal_fat)
dairy_queen_mean

```


```{r}

dairy_queen_sd   <- sd(dairy_queen$cal_fat)
dairy_queen_sd

```

# Now creating the density histogram
```{r}
ggplot(data = dairy_queen, aes(x = cal_fat)) +
        geom_blank() +
        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) +
        stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = c(mean = dairy_queen_mean, sd = dairy_queen_sd), col = "tomato")

```
Exercise 2: Based on the this plot, does it appear that the data follow a nearly normal distribution?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mcdonalds, aes(sample = cal_fat)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "qq")

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
