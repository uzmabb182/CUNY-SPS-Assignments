This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Viewing Data

```{r}
kobe_basket
```

```{r}
glimpse(kobe_basket)
```
# Exercise 1:
#What does a streak length of 1 mean, i.e. how many hits and misses are in a streak of 1? What about a streak length of 0?
## Anwer: Streak length of 1 means, in a streak, he has 1 hit and 1 miss.
## whereas Streak length of 0 means, in a streak, he has 0 hit in first attempt which is counted as 1 miss.
```{r}
# use the custom function calc_streak to calculate them, and store the results in a data frame 
# called kobe_streak as the length variable.

kobe_streak <- calc_streak(kobe_basket$shot)

kobe_streak
```
# the distribution of these streak lengths.
```{r}
ggplot(data = kobe_streak, aes(x = length)) +
  geom_bar()
```
# Exercise 2:
# Describe the distribution of Kobe’s streak lengths from the 2009 NBA finals. What was his typical streak length? How long was # his longest streak of baskets? 

```{r}
##  Answer: Typical Streak length = 0, longest streak = 4
```
# Simulation in R:
# set the ground rules of a random process and then the computer uses random numbers to generate 
# an outcome that adheres to those rules
```{r}
coin_outcomes <- c("heads", "tails")
sample(coin_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
```
# If you wanted to simulate flipping a fair coin 100 times
```{r}
sim_fair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE)

sim_fair_coin
```
# use table to count up the number of heads and tails for a fair tossing of coin
```{r}
table(sim_fair_coin)
```
# to simulate an unfair coin that we know only lands heads 20% of the time
```{r}
sim_unfair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE, 
                          prob = c(0.2, 0.8))

sim_unfair_coin
```
# Exercise 3:
# In your simulation of flipping the unfair coin 100 times, how many flips came up heads? Include the code 
# for sampling the unfair coin in your response.
```{r}
table(sim_fair_coin)
```
# Simulating the Independent Shooter:
# To simulate a single shot from an independent shooter with a shooting percentage of 50% 
```{r}
shot_outcomes <- c("H", "M")
sim_basket <- sample(shot_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)

sim_basket
```
# Exercise 4:
# What change needs to be made to the sample function so that it reflects a shooting percentage of 45%? 
# Make this adjustment, then run a simulation to sample 133 shots. Assign the output of this simulation 
# to a new object called sim_basket.
```{r}
shot_outcomes <- c("H", "M")
sim_basket <- sample(shot_outcomes, size = 133, replace = TRUE, 
                     prob = c(0.45, 0.55))

table(sim_basket)
```
# Exercise 5:
# Using calc_streak, compute the streak lengths of sim_basket, 
# and save the results in a data frame called sim_streak.
```{r}
sim_basket
```

```{r}
sim_streak <- sim_basket %>%
    calc_streak()

sim_streak
```
# Take a look at the distribution of these streak lengths.
```{r}

ggplot(data = sim_streak, aes(x = length)) +
  geom_bar()
```
# Exercise 6:
# Describe the distribution of streak lengths. What is the typical streak length for this simulated 
# independent shooter with a 45% shooting percentage? How long is the player’s longest streak of baskets in 133 shots? 
# Make sure to include a plot in your answer.

```{r}
##Answer: Typical Streak length = 0, longest streak = 6
```
# Exercise 7:
## If you were to run the simulation of the independent shooter a second time, how would you expect 
## its streak distribution to compare to the distribution from the question above? Exactly the same? 
## Somewhat similar? Totally different? Explain your reasoning.
```{r}
# The Distribution will varry because the sample will vary every time we run the simulation.
# Setting the seed will ensure to select the same sample each time.
```
Exercise 8:
# How does Kobe Bryant’s distribution of streak lengths compare to the distribution 
# of streak lengths for the simulated shooter? Using this comparison, do you have 
# evidence that the hot hand model fits Kobe’s shooting patterns? Explain.
```{r}
# The typical streak length is higher for the simulated shooter than the typical Kobe Bryant’s 
# distribution of streak lengths and the longest streak is greater for the simulated shooter.
# Both have independent shooting patterns and there is no evidence that the hot hand model 
# fits Kobe’s shooting patterns.
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
