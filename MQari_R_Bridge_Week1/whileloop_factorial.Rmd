## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r}
num <- as.numeric(readline('Enter number for calculating factorial: '))
num
typeof(num)
```
```{r}
factorial <- num
factorial
typeof(factorial)
```

```{r}
n <- 1
typeof(n)
n <- 1
x <- num
typeof(x)
```

```{r}
while (n < num) {
  x <- x-1
  factorial <- (x*factorial)
   # print(factorial)
  n <- n+1
}
print(factorial)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
