## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

# Reading collage_major data from GitHub

```{r}
collage_major <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv")

collage_major
```
#1 Code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"
```{r}
library("stringr")
```
# Using str_subset funtion to find the matching string
```{r}

major1 <- str_subset(collage_major$Major, "DATA")
major1
```
# Extract matching rows with str_detect
```{r}
major1 <- collage_major[str_detect(collage_major$Major, "DATA"), ]  
major1

```

```{r}
major2 <- str_subset(collage_major$Major, "STATISTICS")
major2
```

```{r}
major2 <- collage_major[str_detect(collage_major$Major, "STATISTICS"), ]  
major2
```
#2 Write code that transforms the data below:
```{r}
# Creating four vectors with quotations added:

fruit_category_1 <- c("\"bell pepper\"", "\"bilberry\"", "\"blackberry\"", "\"blood orange\"")

fruit_category_2 <- c("\"blueberry\"", "\"cantaloupe\"", "\"chili pepper\"", "\"cloudberry\"")

fruit_category_3 <- c("\"elderberry\"", "\"lime\"", "\"lychee\"", "\"mulberry\"")

fruit_category_4 <- c("\"olive\"", "\"lsalal berry\"")

```

```{r}
 writeLines(fruit_category_1)         
```

```{r}
x <- str_c(c(fruit_category_1, fruit_category_2, fruit_category_3, fruit_category_4), collapse = ", ")
writeLines(x)   
```
#3 Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
```{r}
# This will match any one character, which is followed by repetition of same character

str_view(c("abbbbc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c"), "(.)\1\1")
```

```{r}
# This will look for two characters that are repeating in reverse order

str_view(c("grrgff", "a.ccc.c", "a*aa*c", "a c"), "(.)(.)\\2\\1")

```

```{r}
# This will find two character that are repeating itself once

str_view(c("grrrrgff", "a.ccc.c.c", "a*aaaa*c", "a c"), "(..)\1")
```

```{r}
# 1-This will find a character, 2- followed by any one character 3- and repeat of 1st character 
# and again repeat step 2 and 3.
str_view(c("grrrrgff", "a.c2c3c.c.c", "a*adafaa*c"), "(.).\\1.\\1")
```

```{r}
# This will find three charactrs followed by any number of other characters
# then the repeat of first three character in reverse order

str_view(c("lmnx*xmnlff", "a.uzmac2c3camzu.c.c", "a*adafaa*c"), "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1")
```
#4 Construct regular expressions to match words that:
```{r}
# Start and end with the same character.
# (.).*\\1

str_view(c("lmnx*xmnl", "a.uzmac2c3camzu.c.a", "a*adafaa*c"), "(.).*\\1")

```

```{r}
# Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)
# (.)(.).*\\1\\1

str_view(c("lmnx*xmnl", "a.uzmac2c3camzu.c.a", "churchac"), "(.)(.).*\\1\\2")
```

```{r}
# Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)

str_view(c("lmnx*xmnl", "eleven", "churchac"), "(.).*\\1*\\1*\\1")
```
