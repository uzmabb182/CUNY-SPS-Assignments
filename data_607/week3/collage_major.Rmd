When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

# Reading collage_major data from GitHub

```{r}
collage_major <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/all-ages.csv")

collage_major
```
# Code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"
```{r}
library("stringr")
```
# Using str_subset funtion to find the matching string
```{r}

major1 <- str_subset(collage_major$Major, "DATA")
major1
```
# Extract matching rows with str_detect
```{r}
major1 <- collage_major[str_detect(collage_major$Major, "DATA"), ]  
major1

```

```{r}
major2 <- str_subset(collage_major$Major, "STATISTICS")
major2
```

```{r}
major2 <- collage_major[str_detect(collage_major$Major, "STATISTICS"), ]  
major2
```
