## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Import Libraries:
```{r}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Reading HTML file
```{r }
# Get working directory path
path <- getwd()

path
```

```{r}
# Start by reading a HTML page with read_html():

html_data<- read_html("C:/Users/Uzma/CUNY-SPS-Assignments/data_607/week7/books_data.html")

html_data
```

# Load the JSON Package


```{r}
library("rjson")
```

# Read a JSON file

```{r}
# Give the input file name to the function.
json_data <- fromJSON(file = "C:/Users/Uzma/CUNY-SPS-Assignments/data_607/week7/books_data.json")

str(json_data)
```
# loading the library and other important packages

```{r}
library("XML")
library("methods")
```

# the contents of books_data.xml are parsed

```{r}

xml_data <- xmlParse(file = "C:/Users/Uzma/CUNY-SPS-Assignments/data_607/week7/books_data.xml")
 
print(xml_data)
```
