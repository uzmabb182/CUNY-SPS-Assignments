This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```

# Analysis:

```{r}
# From the data provided in the efficacy vs severe diseases, which represent the ratio of the severe cases in vaccinated populationvs the unvaccinated population, we conclude that the fully vaccinated population is 98% less likely to contract severe deseases than the unvaccinated people below 50 age.

# For above 50 age group, afficacy fall down to 85.2%

# While for the total population, the efficacy drop down to 67.5%

# The reason is because the severe cases in the over 50 population are happening at a rate of 92% and this is causing overall average to go down.
