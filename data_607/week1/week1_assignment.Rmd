## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

# Introduction:
##Title: How Baby Boomers Get High
### This dataset covers the story behind "How Baby Boomers Get High" and it covers 13 drugs across 17 age groups.
### It holds the records of percentage of those in age group who used these 13 drugs in the last 12 months.
### It holds the records of median number of times a user in an age group uses these drugs in the last 12 months.

# Load Libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```
# Import CSV Data from Github:
```{r}
drug_df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzmabb182/CUNY-SPS-Assignments/main/data_607/week1/drug-use-by-age.csv")
```

```{r}
drug_df
```
# gsub() funtion searches for the charater to replace in the column names
```{r}
names(drug_df) <- gsub("-", "_", names(drug_df))
drug_df
```
# EDA: Fetching column names
```{r}
colnames(drug_df) 
```
# Rename a single column name
```{r}
names(drug_df)[2] <- "sample_size"
str(drug_df)
```
#Identifying and subseting the columns to replace the value
```{r}
drug_df[ ,7:27 ][drug_df[ ,7:27] == '-'] <- '0'
drug_df
```
# Checking the data for value changes
```{r}
head(drug_df)
```
# Subset by column and row:
## # Selecting an age group with 50% or more use of alcohol
```{r}
high_alcohol_use <- drug_df %>%                             # Using dplyr functions
  select(age, sample_size, alcohol_use, alcohol_frequency) %>% 
  filter(alcohol_use >= 50)
high_alcohol_use    

```

```{r}
summary(high_alcohol_use)
```

```{r}
ggplot(high_alcohol_use, aes(x = age, y = alcohol_use, fill = alcohol_use)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_classic()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = drug_df, aes(x = age, y = marijuana_use, color= marijuana_use)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Marijuana Use by Age in past 12 Months")
  geom_smooth(method=lm) # add linear trend line
```
# Selection Using Subset function:
```{r}
# using subset function
heroin_data <- subset(drug_df, age >= 20,
select=c(age, heroin_use, heroin_frequency))
heroin_data
```
# Visual presentation
```{r}
ggplot(data = heroin_data, aes(x = age, y = heroin_use, color= heroin_use)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm) # add linear trend line
```

```{r}
ggplot(drug_df, aes(x = age, y = cocaine_use, fill = cocaine_use)) +

    coord_flip() +
    theme_classic()
```
# Conclusion Analysis:
```{r}
# Alcohol_use is highest anong the age group of 22-23 
#  Alcohol_use Mean: 55.43%

# Marijuana_use is highest among the age group of 18-20
# Marijuana_use Mean: 18.92%


# Heroin_use is highest anong the age group of 22-23
# Heroin_use Mean: 0.3529%


# Cocaine_use is highest anong the age group of 20-21
# Cocaine_use  Mean: 0.2941%  

# The boomers aged 50 to 64, have lower rates of drug use overall than their younger generations

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
