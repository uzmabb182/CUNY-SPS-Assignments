## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(odbc)
sort(unique(odbcListDrivers()[[1]]))
```


```{r}
library(DBI)
```

```{r}
library(RODBC)
```

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                     Driver = "PostgreSQL Unicode",
                     Database = "movies_db",
                     UserName = "postgres",
                     Password = "",
                     Servername = "localhost",
                     Port = 5432)
```

```{r}
con
```

```{r}
movie_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM movie")
movie_df
```

```{r}
movie_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM movie")
movie_df
```

```{r}
rating_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM rating")
rating_df
```

```{r}
site_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM site")
site_df
```

```{r}
consumer_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM consumer")
consumer_df
```

```{r}
movie_site_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM site_movie")
movie_site_df
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
