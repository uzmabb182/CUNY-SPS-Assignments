## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(odbc)
sort(unique(odbcListDrivers()[[1]]))
```

```{r}
library(DBI)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(RODBC)
```
# Creating the connection to the PostgreSQL
```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                     Driver = "PostgreSQL Unicode",
                     Database = "tbdata_db",
                     UserName = "postgres",
                     Password = "",
                     Servername = "localhost",
                     Port = 5432)
```

```{r}
con
```
# Fetching data from PostgreSQL
```{r}
tb_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM tb")
tb_df
```

```{r}
summary(tb_df)
```

```{r}
str(tb_df)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
population_df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzmabb182/CUNY-SPS-Assignments/main/data_607/week2/population.csv")
```

```{r}
population_df
```

```{r}
data_merge1 <- merge(tb_df, population_df, by = c("country", "year"))       # Applying merge() function
data_merge1
```
```{r}
data_merge1 <- data_merge1 %>%                               # Replacing values
  mutate(child = replace(child, child == -1, 0))

data_merge1
```

```{r}
data_merge1 <- data_merge1 %>%                               # Replacing values
  mutate(adult = replace(adult, adult == -1, 0))

data_merge1
```

```{r}
data_merge1 <- data_merge1 %>%                               # Replacing values
  mutate(elderly = replace(elderly, elderly == -1, 0))

data_merge1
```


# create an R dataframe that shows rates of tuberculosis infection by country:
# To solve this I am taking the most recent year population in data.
```{r}

data_merge1 <- data_merge1 %>% filter(year==2013) %>% mutate(sumrow= child + adult + elderly)

data_merge1
```
# Grouping by population and adding the row values of male and female infections
```{r}
data_merge1 <- data_merge1 %>%
        group_by(country) %>%
        summarise(pop = mean(population), total_infection = sum(sumrow))

data_merge1

```
# Now calculating the rate of infection by country and 0 means no data reported for that country
```{r}
data_merge1 <- data_merge1 %>% mutate(rate = (total_infection/pop)*100)
   
data_merge1  

```

```{r}

```
