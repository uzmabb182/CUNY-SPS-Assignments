## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(odbc)
sort(unique(odbcListDrivers()[[1]]))
```

```{r}
library(DBI)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(RODBC)
```
# Creating the connection to the PostgreSQL
```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                     Driver = "PostgreSQL Unicode",
                     Database = "tbdata_db",
                     UserName = "postgres",
                     Password = "",
                     Servername = "localhost",
                     Port = 5432)
```

```{r}
con
```
# Fetching data from PostgreSQL
```{r}
tb_df = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM tb")
tb_df
```

```{r}
summary(tb_df)
```

```{r}
str(tb_df)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
population_df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzmabb182/CUNY-SPS-Assignments/main/data_607/week2/population.csv")
```

```{r}
population_df
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
