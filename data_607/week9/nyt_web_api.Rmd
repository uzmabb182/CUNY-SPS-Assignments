# Loading the Libraries:
```{r}

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
```

# Brief Overview:

## Task: In this assignment, the task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, request the API key, 
## contruct the URL, perform an API call to fetch the JSON data from the server, and finally 
## transform the data into R dataframe.
## Purpose: is to collect the current data information into the dataframe in R for statistcal analysis.
## API Selected: In this assignment I am choosing the Books API, which provides information about book 
## reviews and The New York Times Best Sellers list.

# Access the NYT API Key:
```{r}
apikey <- "04GA736x2mowjM9AOusr0XYdn2t3uVSN"
```

# Construct the URL for NYTimes API call
# The lists/names service returns a list of all the NYT Best Sellers Lists.
# Using "current" for {date} to get the latest list.
```{r}
url <-  paste0("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3//lists/current/hardcover-fiction.json?api-key=",apikey)

url
```

# Fetch response:
```{r}
response <- GET(url)

response
```
# Checking the status code of the response
```{r}

response$status_code

```
# Extract headers with headers()
```{r}
headers(response)
```
# Extract content from the body with $content or content()--use 'text'

```{r}
data <- content(response, "text")
```

# Making the data readable using "prettify" function

```{r}
json_data <- content(response, "text")

prettify(json_data)
```
# Converting into a R dataframe
```{r}
books_df <- fromJSON(url, flatten = TRUE)
books_df <- books_df$results
books_df <- books_df$books

books_df
```
# Check the data type
```{r}
str(books_df)
```

```{r}
books_df %>%
  names
```

```{r}
books_df$rank_last_week
```

# sort dataframe by column
```{r}
 
books_df <- books_df[order(books_df$rank_last_week),]
books_df
```
